## Introduction to **vegan** | a potted history

 * Jari Oksanen released first version of vegan to CRAN on September 5th 2001
 * Limited scope; purpose was to have Peter Minchin's DECODA-like functions for NMDS available in R plus helper functions
 * By version 1.4, vegan had DCA & CCA, with RDA following in 1.4.2. `ordisurf()` appeared in 1.4 also as did permutation tests.
 * From version 1.6, vegan expanded into areas of theoretical ecology and diversity
 * Version 1.6.5 brought the `metaMDS()` wrappers for NMDS
 * Since then vegan has rapidly developed on the R-Forge website and expanded considerably
 * Current development team: Jari Oksanen, F. Guillaume Blanchet, Roeland Kindt, Pierre Legendre, Peter R. Minchin, R. B. O'Hara, Gavin L. Simpson, Peter Solymos, M. Henry H. Stevens, Helene Wagner

## Introduction to **vegan** | vegan today

 * The current stable release is version 2.0.10 which is available from CRAN
 * [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan]()
 * Development is mainly conducted via [r-forge.r-project.org]() with a separate development version
 * Development branch is 2.1.x will soon be released to CRAN as the 2.2 release branch
 * R-forge also hosts our bug tracking, mailing lists \& forums which should be first port of call for getting help
 * [http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/vegan]()
 * Also several vignettes (manuals/guides) containing R code to explain how vegan works
 * The vegan tutorial is available at [http://vegan.r-forge.r-project.org]()

## Cleaning your data for R and vegan

### Loading dirty data and then cleaning
```{r dirty-data-1, eval=FALSE}
setwd("your/working/directory/")
BCI.small.csv.in <- read.csv("data/BCI_small.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
```
RStudio example



## Cleaning your data for R and vegan

### Loading dirty data and then cleaning
```{r dirty-data-2, eval=TRUE}
BCI.small.csv.in <- read.csv("data/BCI_small_fixed.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
```



## Cleaning your data for R and vegan

Then...  
```{r dirty-data-3}
head(BCI.small.csv.in, n=3)
```



## Cleaning your data for R and vegan

Then...  
```{r dirty-data-4}
summary(BCI.small.csv.in)
```



## Cleaning your data for R and vegan

We will now switch to using one of vegan's built-in datasets for species (`BCI`) and environmental variables from the same paper, which we will load directly
    
* from Condit et al. 2002 *Science*

```{r loading-BCI, results='hide'}
library("vegan")
data(BCI)
BCI.env <- read.csv("data/BCI.env.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
```

# Calculating community distances



## Calculating distances with `vegdist()` | so many distance metrics, so little time!

### Many different community distance metrics are available in `vegdist()`    
*manhattan, euclidean, canberra, bray, kulczynski, jaccard, gower, altGower, morisita, horn, mountford, raup, binomial, chao, or cao*

*manhattan, euclidean, canberra, bray, kulczynski, jaccard, gower, altGower, morisita, horn, mountford, raup, binomial, chao, or cao*

```{r dist-jacc-1}
spec.jaccpa <- vegdist(BCI, method = "jaccard", binary = TRUE)
# returns an object of class 'dist'
str(spec.jaccpa) 
```



## Calculating distances with `vegdist()` | so many distance metrics, so little time!

```{r dist-jacc-2}
as.matrix(spec.jaccpa)[1:4,1:4]
```




## Calculating distances with `vegdist()` | so many distance metrics, so little time!

### How to choose a good one for your data set?  
### First step, read the help for vegdist
```{r vegdist-help, eval=FALSE}
?vegdist
```



## Calculating distances with `vegdist()` | so many distance metrics, so little time!

### Second, try `rankindex()`    
Higher rank correlations indicate better separation along gradients
```{r rankindex-1}
rank.UTM.NS <- rankindex(BCI.env$UTM.NS, BCI, indices = 
              c("bray", "euclid", "manhattan", "horn"), method = "spearman")
rank.UTM.NS
```



## Calculating distances with `vegdist()` | so many distance metrics, so little time!

### Second, try `rankindex()`    
Can also use on standardized data
```{r rankindex-2}
rank.UTM.NS.wisc <- rankindex(BCI.env$UTM.NS, wisconsin(BCI), indices = 
              c("bray", "euclid", "manhattan", "horn"), method = "spearman")
rank.UTM.NS.wisc
```



## Calculating distances with `vegdist()` | comparison

```{r rankindex-3}
sort(rank.UTM.NS, decreasing = TRUE)
sort(rank.UTM.NS.wisc, decreasing = TRUE)
```



## Activity

There is a data file in the workshop repositiory, in the `01-intro-basics/data/` folder called `varespec.xlsx`.  

1. Download this file (which has errors)
2. Make a copy
3. Clean it up
4. Load it into R
5. Try at least two different methods to standardize the data.
6. Evaluate at least five different community distance metrics with `rankindex()`
7. Calculate community distances using that metric.



# Diversity metrics



## Alpha diversity

Basic counts of richness for each plot or site
```{r alpha-1}
site.richness <- apply(BCI > 0, 1, sum)
site.richness[1:18]
```



## Alpha diversity | Other metrics

Fisher's alpha
```{r alpha-2}
site.fisher <- fisher.alpha(BCI)
site.fisher[1:12]
```



## Alpha diversity | Other metrics

Shannon diversity
```{r alpha-3}
site.shannon <- diversity(BCI, index = "shannon", MARGIN = 1)
site.shannon[1:12]
```



## Rarefaction

This is the same as `apply(BCI > 0, MARGIN = 1, sum)`    
it gives the species count for each plot
```{r rarefac-1}
BCI.S <- specnumber(BCI)
```
This finds the plot with the least number of individuals
```{r rarefac-2}
# could also use rowsums() instead of apply()
BCI.raremax <- min(apply(BCI, 1, sum))
```



## Rarefaction

Rarefy BCI species matrix to the minimum number of individuals in any plot    
and plot the relationship between observed and rarefied counts (plus add 1-1 line)
```{r rarefac-3, fig.height=4}
BCI.Srare <- rarefy(BCI, BCI.raremax)
plot(BCI.S, BCI.Srare, xlab = "Observed No. of Species", ylab = "Rarefied No. of Species")
abline(0, 1)
```



## Rarefaction

Put it all together
```{r rarefac-4, fig.height=5.5}
rarecurve(BCI, step = 20, sample = BCI.raremax, col = "blue", cex = 0.6)
```



## Beta diversity

Multivariate homogeneity of groups dispersions
```{r beta-1}
BCI.bray <- vegdist(BCI, method = "bray")
(BCI.bray.bdisp <- betadisper(BCI.bray,group = as.factor(BCI.env$UTM.NS)))
```



## Beta diversity {.smaller}

Multivariate homogeneity of groups dispersions
```{r beta-2}
permutest(BCI.bray.bdisp)
```




## Beta diversity

Plot of within-group multivariate dispersion
```{r beta-3, fig.height=4.5}
plot(BCI.bray.bdisp)
```



## Beta diversity

Boxplot of within-group multivariate dispersion
```{r beta-4, fig.height=5.5}
boxplot(BCI.bray.bdisp)
```



## Beta diversity | ANOSIM

Analysis of similarities 
```{r beta-5, fig.height=4.5}
(BCI.bray.anosim <- anosim(BCI.bray, as.factor(BCI.env$UTM.NS)))
```



## Beta diversity | ANOSIM

Analysis of similarities 
```{r beta-6, fig.height=4.5}
plot(BCI.bray.anosim)
```


## PERMANOVA using `adonis`

Analysis of variance using distance matrices and for fitting linear models to distance matrices
```{r adonis}
adonis(BCI ~ BCI.env$Age.cat)
```
